- Date: 1 October 2024

## Description

"Mini Project: API Integration" utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create an immersive and interactive experience into the Pokemon universe using the PokeAPI to access information about Pokemon characters. The application consists of three main functionalities:

- **Home Page**: A landing page with welcome text and a button prompting users to get started on their journey into the world of Pokemon.
- **Search Page**: A search page consisting of an input field and a "Search" button which, when pressed, displays information based on user input (case-insensitive).
- **Display Pokemon Details**: Details about the Pokemon the user enters in the search bar will display below the bar once the user enters the name of a Pokemon and clicks the "Search" button. The Pokemon's name, image, abilities, and base experience will appear.
